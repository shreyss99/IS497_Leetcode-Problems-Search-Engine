# Leetcode-Problems-Search-Engine

## Project Title: Leetcode Problems Web Application with Aurora and AWS

## Overview:

Our project aims to build a scalable web application using Aurora as the database engine and AWS as the cloud service. The web application will be a search engine that looks to suggest various leetcode problems with the URLs based on the search criteria entered by the user. 

## Technologies Used:

* AWS Aurora: as the database engine
* AWS EC2: as the cloud server
* AWS IAM
* Django: as the web application framework 

## Data Set:

The dataset that we have chosen is the ‘Leetcode Problem Dataset’ available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of 1825 leetcode problems and various 19 features like the problem title, its URL, the description of the problem, its frequency, solution link, if it requires premium subscription or not and so on. The dataset is 2.22 MB.

## Project Goals:

* To demonstrate how Aurora and AWS can be used to build a scalable and performant web application.
* To implement a simple yet functional search engine where users can enter their query parameters through a simple form and get results.
* To ensure the web application is secure, with appropriate access controls and communication protocols in place.
